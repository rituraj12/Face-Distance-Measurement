This project is built using OpenCV, Mediapipe and CV Zone(version 1.5.4) libraries. OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Mediapipe offers opensource cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media. Not to mention the Numpy library which brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use.(which is basically used for image processing, quantum computing, statistical computing, signal processing etc.)

This Face Distance module it calculate the distance between a person’s face and a computer’s webcam.
